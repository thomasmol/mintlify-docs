The standard model is based on the GPT-4o API with a custom system prompt based on the chosen UserActivation.

Costs are `$0.005` per 1k of input tokens and `$0.015` per 1k of output tokens.

A transcript of a 30 minute conversation is around 4k tokens (input tokens). The summary output for such a transcript is around 1k tokens (output tokens). Resulting in an estimated total cost of `$0.035`.

### Example
