The enhanced model is based on the standard model, but does LLM-based post processing to improve the accuracy of the transcription, get more detailed diarization segments, and infer labels or names of speakers.

The enhanced model can work well for languages that are lower in the accuracy of the standard model.

<Warning>Unlike the standard model, the enhanced model does not output word level timestamps and confidence scores.</Warning>

Costs are `$0.0005` per second of audio equivalent to `$1.80` per hour of audio.
