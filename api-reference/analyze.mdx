title: 'Analyze Transcript'
openapi: 'POST /v1/analyze'
---

Analyze a transcript to extract information from it. The analyze endpoint supports 1 action (more coming soon):

- Summarize: Extracts the main points of a transcript and returns a summary of the conversation.

No need to poll the status of the job, the analyze endpoint will return the result immediately.

Currently the endpoint is based on the GPT-4o API with a custom system prompt based on the chosen action.

You must pre-process your transcript before sending it to the endpoint. The endpoint will not do any pre-processing.

<Warning>The endpoint is currently in beta and may change in the future.</Warning>
