</Tip>

## Transcribe a Remote File (from url)

If you have a media file accessible via a URL, you can provide the URL to the file in the request body with the header `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

Typically you would use this method if you have a file stored in a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3.

<Warning>Make sure the URL to the file is publicly accessible, otherwise our endpoint cannot read the file</Warning>


## Transcribe a Local File

If you have a media file stored locally, you can provide the file in the request body with the header `Content-Type` set to `multipart/form-data`.

Typically you would use this method if you have a file stored on a local machine or device.

## Receiving the transcript (Webhook)

The webhook URL is where the finished transcript will be sent. The transcript will be sent as a JSON object in the request body.

<Warning>Make sure the webhook URL is publicly accessible, otherwise our endpoint cannot send the transcript</Warning>
