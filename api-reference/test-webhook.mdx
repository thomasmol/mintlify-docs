Test endpoint. Returns a 200 status code if the server is running and your API key is valid. Also sends a request to the webhook URL you provided in the request body.

Use this endpoint to test your webhook URL and verify that it is working correctly.

Don't have a webhook URL? Websites like [Webhook.cool](https://webhook.cool/) and [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) can help you create a temporary URL to test your webhook.
