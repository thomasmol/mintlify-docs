The Spectropic API currently supports two models for transcription and diraization. The `standard` model is the default model and is suitable for most use cases. The `enhanced` model is more accurate but slower.


|  Model     | Languages | Price per second      | Price per hour          |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| `standard` | all       | $0.0001 / second of audio      | $0.36 / hour of audio   |
| `enhanced` | all       | $0.0005 / second of audio      | $1.80 / hour of audio   |

More details about evaluation soon.
